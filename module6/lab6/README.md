## Future Learning Pathways 
Mozilla has a really excellent set of tutorials on Django if you'd like to dig deeper and get a more comprehensive look at how to build web apps in Django: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django

For a quick end-to-end tutorial/refresh on Django, try: https://www.ordinarycoders.com/build-a-django-web-app 

If we had time, I would have love to cover JavaScript. If you'd like to get acquainted, here's a good set of starter materials:
 - Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
 - CS50 actually builds on Django with Javascript, so you can try it too: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/5/
